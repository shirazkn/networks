## Some useful notes for getting started:

### Iterables
`a = {}` is a **set** in python. You can add some object `val` to `a` using `a.add(val)`. 
Sets are unordered and immutable.

`a = {"key": val}` is a **dictionary** or dict. The keys of a dict behave like sets (unordered). You can add items using `a["new_key"]=val`. You can iterate over the keys using `for key in a.keys(): ...`, or over the values using `for val in a.values(): ...`.

`a = []` is a List, which is ordered. You can add items using `a.append(val)`. You can iterate over a list using `for val in a: ...`. If you also want to use the indices, try `for index, val in enumerate(a): ...` or `for index, val in zip(range(len(a)), a): ...`. 

Lists, sets and dicts are also called iterables. The function `zip(_,_)` essentially lets you iterate over the 'pairs' generated by two ordered iterables.

### Numpy
`numpy.array(a)` generates a numpy array from a Python iterable. Use the `column()` function in `functions.misc` to ensure that something is a column vector (otherwise numpy swaps between row and column vectors based on context, which can cause inconsistencies).

### Functions
The `__init__.py` indicates that the folder `res_local/functions` is to be treated like a Python package.
Since the code is run from the `res_local/` folder, that is the root folder. For e.g., `functions/graph.py` imports other modules in functions but refers to their path relative to the root folder, such as: `from functions import misc`.
